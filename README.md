# Knowladge Base

It's a website that allows to create, edit, and search posts. 
- Backend - Firebase
- Fronted - JavaScript and Lit component.

The website is deployed on GitHub pages -> https://mrozowski.github.io/knowledge-base/#

I create my own text editor based on markdown language. Only logged-in users can create new posts. The editor allows to create all the elements that are available in markdown language. 
It also allows to copy and paste pictures. It automatically saves the file on Firebase storage.
